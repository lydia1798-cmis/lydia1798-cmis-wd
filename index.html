				Description of "Lists and Links"
			</h2>
				<p>
					This assignment was to teach us how to code lists and links in HTML. In this assignment we were supposed to create a list of instructions to how to create and then view a website on the production server. After that we were supposed to create a list of links to wesites with useful web design information. After that we had to add a link to our main wesite (this one) and we had to link back from this one to our lists and links site. Then we had to do this as well as the requirements down below. Then we have to turn it in.
